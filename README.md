# FizzBuzz

C# Implementation of FizzBuzz (ASP.NET Core 3)

Fizz buzz (often spelled FizzBuzz in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers.
Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability.

## The Question

The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:

For numbers 1 through 100,

* if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
* if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
* if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
* else, print the number.
